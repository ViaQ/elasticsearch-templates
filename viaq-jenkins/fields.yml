_default_:
  type: group
  description: >
    Contains common fields, corresponds to mappings of the _default_.
    This mapping represents generic Jenkins configuration.
  fields:
    - name: "@timestamp"
      type: date
      format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSSSSZ||yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZ||dateOptionalTime
      example: 2015-01-24T14:06:05.071Z
      description: >
        UTC value marking when the log payload was created, or when log payload was first collected if the creation time is not known; 
        this is the log processing pipeline’s “best effort” determination of when the log payload was generated
        FYI: the “@” prefix convention to note a field as being reserved for a particular use; in this case, most tools by default look for “@timestamp” with ElasticSearch
        Collected by shipshift from Jenkins, when the message was emitted.
      fields:
        - name: raw
          ignore_above: 256
          type: string
          index: not_analyzed

    - name: "@version"
      index: not_analyzed
      type: string
      example: TODO
      description: >
        Version of “com.redhat.viaq” mapping the document is intended to adhere to at the time of creation; this allows us to potentially migrate data from an older mapping to a new mapping if necessary (see the Logstash Jira 675 on their schema change)

      type: string
      index: not_analyzed
      description: >
        FQDN of the entity generating the original payload
        This field is a best effort attempt to derive this context; sometimes the entity generating it knows it; other times that entity has a restricted namespace itself, and the collector or normalizer knows that

      description: >
        Field contains whitespace-delimited tags or an array of tag strings. Tagging is configured on normalizers/collectors.

        description: >
          The original non-parsed log message, collected by collector or as close to the source as possible.
